## Introduction

This repository is a collection of animations created using the Manim library in Python. Manim is a powerful animation engine for explanatory math videos. Each animation is organized by the year it was created, allowing for easy navigation and exploration.

## Installation

<!-- To run the animations locally, you'll need to have Python and Manim installed. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/animations.git
    cd animations
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Install Manim by following the [official installation guide](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html). -->

## Directory Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
animations/
├── 2024/
│ ├── shorts/
│ ├── youtube/
│ └── ...
└── README.md
```

- Each year's folder contains the Python scripts for the animations created for shorts (instagram as well) and youtube long videos.
- The `README.md` file provides an overview and instructions for the repository.

## Usage

<!-- To run an animation, navigate to the directory of the desired year and execute the corresponding Python script with Manim. For example, to run `animation1.py` from 2020:

```bash
cd 2020
manim -p -ql animation1.py
``` 

This command will render the animation and play it once rendering is complete. You can adjust the rendering quality and other parameters as needed. For more information on using Manim, refer to the Manim documentation. -->
